# topspeedfive
## Summary
**topspeedfive** is a place for pedestrians to find paths, apps, meetups, tips, tricks, secrets, articles, photos, videos and, most importantly, other humans for long distance walking. While there is a general emphasis on intercity and even interstate travel, the importance of local pedestrian support is crucial to any such endeavor.

Walking includes all forms of human powered transportation that could reasonably be called walking, or used in place of walking with feet if that's unavailable. Wheelchairs, crutches, canes, etc. all _count_ here. Rollerblades, bikes, skateboards, etc. do _not_.
