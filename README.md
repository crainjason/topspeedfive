# topspeedfive
## Summary
topspeedfive is a place for pedestrians to find paths, conversations, meetups, and other resources for long distance walking. This includes all forms of human powered transportation that could reasonably be called walking, or used in place of walking with feet if that's unavailable to you. Wheelchairs, crutches, canes, etc. all _count_ here. Rollerblades, bikes, skateboards, etc. do _not_.

The definition of __long distance__ is flexible, and can be scaled to match a context. The inspiration for this project was multi-day intercity travel by foot. It quickly became clear that limitation was too extreme. But the spirit remains the same: the focus here is on distance travel over lunchtime walks or afternoon strolls.

## Building and Maintaining Resources
The main purpose of topspeedfive is to build, maintain, and distribute resources for walking. This will include maps, media, apps, etc., that help people walk more. Conversation will be enabled, but it's not the sole or even primary purpose.

## Prosocial Competition
Competition is natural, but not everyone will be interested. For that reason we will have specific areas and resources for competition. Competitive interactions won't be tolerated outside of that bubble.

Even then, a lot of the competitive people here are tired of torture-fest, over-the-top rhetoric. We will keep the conversation focused on prosocial competition. We can talk about who walked the most miles, the most consecutive days, or who did something the fastest. But this isn't the place to brag about how you broke your knee and kept going, or how you don't accept imperfection. David Goggins wouldn't really like it here.
