# topspeedfive
## Summary
topspeedfive is a place for pedestrians to find paths, apps, meetups, and other resources for long distance walking. This includes all forms of human powered transportation that could reasonably be called walking, or used in place of walking with feet if that's unavailable to you. Wheelchairs, crutches, canes, etc. all _count_ here. Rollerblades, bikes, skateboards, etc. do _not_.

> The definition of __long distance__ is flexible, and can be scaled to match different contexts. The inspiration for this project was multi-day intercity travel by foot. While that definition is too limiting, morning nature walks and afternoon strolls in the park are not what we do here.
