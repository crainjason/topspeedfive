# topspeedfive
## Summary
**topspeedfive** is a place for pedestrians to find paths, apps, meetups, tips, tricks, secrets, articles, photos, videos and, most importantly, other humans for long distance walking.

Walking includes all forms of human powered transportation that could reasonably be called walking, or used in place of walking with feet if that's unavailable to you. Wheelchairs, crutches, canes, etc. all _count_ here. Rollerblades, bikes, skateboards, etc. do _not_.
