## Building and Maintaining Resources
The main purpose of topspeedfive is to build, maintain, and distribute resources for walking. This will include maps, media, apps, etc., that help people walk more. Conversation will be enabled, but it's not the sole or even primary purpose.

## Hiking vs Walking
Hiking is a unique kind of walking _"in nature"_, often among trails. Distance hiking requires shitting in the woods and sleeping outside.

The goal of topspeedfive is not to reprint or recreate the massive amount of content and resources for the hiker. The goal is provide new or at least novel resources to distance walkers. Expect to see a lot of walking through towns and cities, on sidewalks and along roads, and sleeping in hotels without shame.

## Prosocial Competition
Competition is natural, but not everyone will be interested. For that reason we will have specific areas and resources for competition. Competitive interactions won't be tolerated outside of that bubble.

Even then, a lot of the competitive people here are tired of torture-fest, over-the-top rhetoric. We will keep the conversation focused on prosocial competition. We can talk about who walked the most miles, the most consecutive days, or who did something the fastest. But this isn't the place to brag about how you broke your knee and kept going, or how you don't accept imperfection. David Goggins wouldn't really like it here.
