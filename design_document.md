# Summary
Take the summary from the README and put it here.

## Inspiration
In no particular order, Diogenes, Edward Payson Weston, and defenders of the right to roam.

In order to exercise what is best is that which is nearby and contributes to health. That's walking. What is an interesting competitive wager? Who can walk across the US the fastest. Where should one be able to travel walk? Wherever one may walk do no damage.

## Target Audience
People who enjoy distance walking and are looking for resources. People who walk to work or in the park. People who walk town to town. People who walk across countries. People who wander and people who beeline straight for the target. People in wheelchairs, with crutches, etc., are welcome.

People who walk for distance for any reason.

# Concept

## Overview
People should be able to find the website easily and use it as a trailhead to other resources for walkers. We should have a Discord for respectful conversation and announcements. Maps will likely feature heavily, as well as applications that allow us to modify maps for effective walking travel. And of course there should be a section of media focused on distance writing.

## Founding Principals
- Anyone can walk long distances.
- Everyone should walk long distances, at least ocasionally.
- Distance walking is contextual and fluid, but is not a morning walk to the corner.
- Wheelchairs, crutches, etc., all _count_ here.
