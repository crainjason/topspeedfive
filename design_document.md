# Summary
topspeedfive is a place for pedestrians to find paths, apps, meetups, tips, tricks, secrets, articles, photos, videos and, most importantly, other humans for long distance walking. 

## Inspiration
In no particular order, Diogenes, Edward Payson Weston, William "Upski" Wimsatt, Nimblewill Nomad, Werner Herzog, Patrick Leigh Fermor (probably) and defenders of the right to roam.

The best exercise is nearby and is challenging. That's walking. What is an interesting competitive wager? Who can walk across the US the fastest. Where should one travel? Wherever one may walk safely.

## Target Audience
People who enjoy distance walking and are looking for resources. People who walk to work or in the park. People who walk town to town. People who walk across countries. People who wander and people who beeline straight for the target. People in wheelchairs, with crutches, etc.

People who walk for distance for any reason.

> People without feet can walk.

> Walking is political.

# Concept

## Overview
People should be able to find the website easily and use it as a trailhead to other resources for distance walkers. We should have a Discord for conversation and announcements. Maps will likely feature heavily, as well as applications that allow us to modify maps.

## Founding Principals
- Anyone can walk long distances.
- Everyone should walk long distances occasionally.
- Distance walking is difficult.
- Long is a relative term.
- You don't need feet to walk.
- Competition can be fun, if you're not a dick about it.
- David Goggins wouldn't like it here.
