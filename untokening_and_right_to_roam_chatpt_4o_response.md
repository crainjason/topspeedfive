# Part 1: Introduction to Right to Roam and Untokening
The "Right to Roam" movement in the United States focuses on increasing pedestrian rights and access to land, allowing individuals to travel freely between cities and states on foot. This movement emphasizes the importance of expanding walkability, reducing legal restrictions on public and private land access, and promoting the freedom to explore the natural and urban landscapes of the country.

In contrast, Untokening is a movement rooted in mobility justice, which seeks to center the lived experiences of marginalized communities—particularly Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC), immigrants, women, and people with disabilities—in transportation and urban planning. While the goals of these two movements seem distinct at first glance, they both address broader concerns related to public space, accessibility, and freedom of movement, making their relationship worth examining.

# Part 2: Shared Goals—Accessibility and Equity in Mobility
Both Right to Roam and Untokening share a foundational goal of making mobility more accessible to a broader range of people. For proponents of Right to Roam, increasing access to land and public spaces is critical to ensuring that anyone can travel freely, regardless of social or economic status. Similarly, Untokening advocates for removing barriers to mobility, particularly those faced by marginalized groups, such as people of color, women, LGBTQ+ individuals, and people with disabilities.

Untokening’s framework of mobility justice explicitly calls for decriminalizing the movement of Black and Brown bodies and protecting the rights of people to navigate public spaces without fear of policing or harassment【7†source】. This aligns with the Right to Roam movement’s vision of creating a more inclusive public space, where everyone has the right to traverse cities, towns, and natural landscapes.

# Part 3: Diverging Perspectives on Land Use and Mobility
Where the two movements diverge is in their approach to land use and mobility planning. Right to Roam focuses largely on the legal and logistical issues of access to land—emphasizing the removal of barriers like private property restrictions and no-trespassing laws. This movement is more likely to focus on rural and suburban areas, advocating for the expansion of trail networks and walking routes that allow individuals to cross between states and regions without encountering prohibitive legal obstacles.

Untokening, on the other hand, tends to prioritize urban mobility, centering the struggles of marginalized groups in navigating cities and public spaces. It emphasizes the historical and ongoing displacement of BIPOC communities due to gentrification, land dispossession, and colonialism【8†source】【9†source】. Untokening's focus on addressing these structural inequities within urban environments might seem tangential to the Right to Roam's rural-oriented goals. However, the two movements could potentially complement each other if both rural and urban mobility concerns are viewed through a shared lens of equity and justice.

# Part 4: Opportunities for Synergy and Areas of Tension
There is an opportunity for synergy between Right to Roam and Untokening in the shared aim of creating more just and accessible public spaces. Both movements advocate for reducing barriers to mobility, though they do so in different contexts—urban vs. rural. One possible area of collaboration could involve expanding urban-to-rural trail networks that consider the needs of marginalized urban communities, ensuring that these individuals also have access to nature and open spaces, free from the limitations posed by privatized land【9†source】.

However, tensions may arise when the goals of increasing access to land intersect with concerns about land use and displacement. Untokening’s emphasis on decolonizing land use and protecting long-standing communities from displacement may be at odds with certain Right to Roam initiatives that could unintentionally perpetuate gentrification or disrupt existing communities. For example, if increased pedestrian access leads to higher real estate development in certain areas, it could exacerbate the very problems of displacement that Untokening seeks to address【7†source】【8†source】.

In conclusion, while Right to Roam and Untokening operate within different frameworks, there are opportunities for collaboration, particularly around making both rural and urban spaces more accessible and equitable for all people. Both movements share a broader vision of mobility justice, even if their strategies and areas of focus differ. The challenge lies in ensuring that increased access does not come at the expense of vulnerable communities—a concern that Untokening keeps at the forefront of its advocacy.
