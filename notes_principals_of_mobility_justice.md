# Notes on Untokening 1.0 - Principals of Mobility Justice
While researching pedestrian focused organizations in Atlanta, I found Untokening 1.0 - Principals of Mobility Justice. It was cited as a foundational document for a local organizing group. You can find the document [at the Untokening website](https://www.untokening.org/updates/2017/11/11/untokening-10-principles-of-mobility-justice).

The Untokening document marks my first exposure to identity politics around pedestrianism and mobility.

This document of notes is my first attempt to record my responses and evolution of thoughts on the matter. It is also an attempt to document the development of topspeedfive founding principals.

# Initial Thoughts

The Principals of Mobility Justice were created and recorded sometime after a meeting in November, 2016. I believe the authors wish to be known as "Untokening Collective." There are no individual names on the document.

The introduction to The Principals opens with the paragraph below. I believe it says a lot about the authors and the coming document.

> Justice-oriented advocates are generally denied the opportunity to bring their whole selves to a space and are more likely to be tokenized â€” forced to pick their battles, to speak within a constrained set of categories, to suffer outright dismissal for straying too far from those categories, and to serve as stand-ins for the entirety of the diverse communities they represent.

When I first read this, I felt inspired and connected to read more. My emotionally vindictive self felt justified in continuing. I wanted to identify as a *justice-oriented advocate*. But as I read on through the intro and continued into the principals themselves, I felt less and less connected. The reasons for this may become clear through the rest of my notes here.

I think that the design of the document contributed to this disconnect. I am not sure of any of the design decisions. It all seems to detract and confuse my eyes. It made the whole thing an effort to read, without any additional payoff. They would have been better off with a standard essay format with some clip art.

To simplify my thoughts: this is a wandering thought in search of a destination, a meandering idea looking for a place to rest. It says a lot. It exhausts attempts to discern what it means.

Perhaps this is what the authors intended. Perhaps conversation is front and center. If so, this is where I diverge from the needs and wants of the authors. I feel a need to see change in legislation. At least I seek signs or steps in that direction. In the absence of immediate change, I yearn for some framework to build toward something, some longer term thinking indicating the authors are planting a seed for quantifiable change.

This might be another reason I lost connection with the text. As much as the authors hope to make an impact, they do little more than rouse a temporary interest.

# Digging Into The Document
The second section of the introduction sets the stage for the reader.

> Each "principle" is broken into three parts:

> Problem: We challenge the current paradigm by illuminating the range of barriers to mobility access that have long plagued marginalized communities.

> Principle: We offer a new vision that lays the foundation necessary to pursue mobility justice.

> Practice: We suggest approaches that can help justice advocates work toward that alternative paradigm, either in white-centered planning spaces or in their own work in marginalized communities.

I contend that the authors fail to adhere to this framework, and I am confused as to why they quote "principle" in the sentence. They do not quote it when describing the this element of their framework. Perhaps they quote it initially to acknowledge that they have started writing a text that defines each principal by using a principal.

Either way, at this point we get to the meat of the thing.

## The Principals

1. Seek to repair harm, not erase history
2. Identity influences vulnerability
3. Prioritize people over profit, property, or placemaking
4. See structural barriers
5. Discard "best practices" respond to local needs
6. Value community voices as essential data
7. Co-create new decisionmaking processes
8. Reject policing as a street safety solution
9. Address environmental racism without green gentrification
10. Cultivate collective, cross-community power

My immediate reaction to the structure of the principals is a realization that I do not spend time reading about identity politics. Points are repeated with very small variation. It seems designed to remind the reader that everyone is different. I do not understand the need to constantly remind people of such an obvious truth.

The points attempt subtle variation, but I do not understand why anyone wants to spend time pointing out the obvious truth that no one should speak for anyone else. It seems equally pointless to rehash how people in power wish to retain it. When a text treats these ideas as novelty, it reminds me of teenagers telling their parents about gayness, or of group sex.

I am not arguing against identity politics. I am admitting ignorance.

I end up squashing these down into three principals. I think that all the other points listed by the author can be found in, or built on, one of the principals below.

1. Let communities organize and speak for themselves
2. Look beyond established practices for other, better solutions
3. Actively protect existing communities and promote diversity

## Green gentrification

Gentrification is incredibly frustrating, and I connect strongly with attacks on the greenwashing side of gentrification. But I struggle to understand why this topic was included in the document.

Yes bike paths and sharing programs are put in areas that are relatively wealthy, or are becoming more wealthy. The same is true of parks and other green infrastructure.

Where cities choose to "improve" communities, they do so in the hopes of driving up tax revenues from wealthier citizens.

But how is this tied to mobility? The document does not do much to clear things up.

The authors discuss how communities have some right, often swept away, to enjoy cleaner environments as cities make improvements. A retired couple who own their home and have lived in a neighborhood should be able to walk in the newly cleaned and upgraded park. They should be able to watch their grand children come to visit via the new protected bike lanes.

But.. again, how is this tied to mobility?

I have a lot of trouble seeing it here... until I adjust my zoom.

My focus for topspeedfive is on national travel and rights. I am looking for more universal rights to move about the country, from city to city, and state to state. I am worried about a citizen's right to exist on private property without any interest other than travel. 

But from the point of view of a local community, mobility can mean the ability to simply walk outside at all. Getting to another town or state is irrelevant. Just going out the front door is what matters. From this perspective I can begin to understand why a clean and safe environment is a focus for the authors.

And yet... I still struggle with making this a foundational idea, a principal on which to build mobility. Why? Because issues of trespass and connectivity to services seems more important.

Not that this is something to emulate, but the suburban dwellers seem more inclined to enjoy this idea. You have a right to the baseball field or the walkway. You must simply drive several miles from your home to enjoy it. So the right to exist on property in order to reach the greenspace has a higher priority.

I am not positing this as an argument or an ideal model. I am recording this here as a note to myself about ranking priorities for myself and for topspeedfive.

Continuing this line of thinking...

It is also possible that interstate travel along greenspaces or protected bike paths would accelerate gentrification on both sides. We can look at distance hiking for how this may work.

Distance hiking is something that is conceptually open to all, but can be very expensive. Buying tents and gear for a comfortable hike takes time and money. And then being outside hiking requires financial independence of some kind. There are books on the politics of camping and hiking. I should probably spend some time digging through that literature.

Beyond the activity itself, land around protected outdoor spaces can become expensive. A quick look at prices around the Blueridge Parkway, which the Appalachian Trail sort of follows, shows this. Newer retirement neighborhoods and second home neighborhoods are a lot more expensive than older homes. Towns benefit from this, attract higher revenue, build additional services, and the cycle continues.

From this position I understand more why the authors included the greenwashing side of gentrification in their principals. I still feel that the focus of topspeedfive should remain on right to roam and universal principals of distance travel.

If we have a right to roam on private land, owning private land around greenspaces in the country becomes less appealing and less important. You don't need to own a second home in the shadow of the reserved hiking spots to enjoy the outdoors. So why crowd the area? This could help put the brakes on gentrification around park lands. 

If we establish a right of all citizens to simply be in the area of outdoor recreation, owning a second home around recreation becomes less exclusive and wealthy. This could mean that rich people look for other ways to show off their wealth. If anyone can be here, why does it matter that I am here with my fancy house?

These ideas are harder to apply in an urban setting where walkways and travel across private property is common, but entirely different than in rural settings. Sidewalks are usually private property. topspeedfive may touch on the use and rights of sidewalks in cities. But, again, the topic is secondary to the rights of a pedestrian walking between towns.

## Racism and policing

Reading through the sections on racism and policing, I start to confront my own confused feelings around identity politics.

I agree with the authors that American policing is racist. I also agree that policing may not be the best way to protect properties. At least, not policing in the sense of sending over an officer with a gun to "protect" property.

But I disagree with rejecting policing as a tool in mobility.

Where I think I disagree with the authors is not that policing in America is both racist and elitist. Where we disagree is the idea that policing cannot be changed, that we can or should eliminate policing.

These topics are massive. They cut to the core of who does and does not have the right to exert violent force in America, and why. They also force people to negotiate with the reality that black and brown bodies are at risk in ways that whites cannot imagine, or purposefully fail to imagine. I say negotiate because the inherent risk of being black or brown seems so well documented, but many people of all walks find ways to dismiss it.

I must admit that I am not interested in conversations about abolishing the police force. The reason is simple: it is an infantile whine. A desire to live in a world free from government coercion of any kind.

The teenage anarchist in me yearns for that mythical return to an idealized world where police enforcement was not necessary. The older anarchist in me remembers probably no civilization has been without it. I would rather return to different kinds of policing, or discover whole new ways of policing, than attempt to escape reality.

I also have something to confess. I do not have a problem with a night time trespasser, one who has cleared a wall or broken through a lock, being mauled by an animal or shot to death on the other side. I have little sympathy for anyone who is entering a building filled with property and or people, knowing they are unwanted, who meets pain or death in the process. 

This is not an argument for the second amendment, or of stand your ground laws. This is another way of dealing with reality. I call it the law of "what did you think would happen when you scared a father of three?"

So how do we deal with racism and policing in mobility and transportation? And how does topspeedfive potentially deal with policing private property, when we believe in a right to roam?

One way is to reduce or eliminate the pretext for which a body may be detained or punished. I would not argue that, especially in the city, a body may not be punished for breaking a lock or scaling a wall, I would argue that a body existing on private property is not a crime.

As simple as this is, much of private property law disagrees. Odds are that many people you ask will also disagree.

But I think we stand a better chance of changing this attitude than we do of abolishing police.

Current interpretations of private property laws mean a lot of people are detained by police on the pretext of being in the wrong place. The right of police to do this has infected the public mind, and many people are unbothered by the idea that just about anyone can be interrupted by armed police for basically no reason. We all think it's funny when our Libertarian uncle gets bent out of shape about this and spends a night in jail. It is a lot less funny when yet another black person is gunned down for exhibiting the same frustration as Uncle Joe.

The same thing can and does happen in more rural areas. Beloved hiking trails are re-routed after 60 years because a new owner fences it off. Family cemeteries are blocked after fifty years or more. Communities lose access to a favorite swimming hole after a new property owner buys everything around it. When a misunderstanding happens, guess who is more likely to make it out alive?

It just begs the question: why do we refuse to let people travel across land? Why do we demand that they have some business other than simply walking, existing, or enjoying?

Why should a new owner have equal or more rights to cemetery land than the eighty year old woman who visits her dead son every week? Why should a developer have more rights to the land than the community who has used it for hunting and recreation for hundreds of years?

The answer of "because the land belongs to X" is an infantile whine. But dad, why do we let those kids walk this way to school? I bought the land. I own it. Me.
