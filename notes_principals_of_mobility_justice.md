# Notes on Untokening 1.0 - Principals of Mobility Justice
While researching pedestrian focused organizations in Atlanta, I found Untokening 1.0 - Principals of Mobility Justice. It was cited as a foundational document for a local organizing group. You can find the document [at the Untokening website](https://www.untokening.org/updates/2017/11/11/untokening-10-principles-of-mobility-justice).

The Untokening document marks my first exposure to intersectional politics around pedestrianism and mobility.

This document of notes is my first attempt to record my responses and evolution of thoughts on the matter. It is also an attempt to document founding principals for topspeedfive.

# Initial Thoughts

The Principals of Mobility Justice were created and recorded sometime after a meeting in November, 2016. I believe the authors wish to be known as "Untokening Collective." There are no individual names on the document
