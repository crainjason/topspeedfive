# Concept

## Overview
Finding the website should be easy. Using the website should leave someone with the sense that they learned something or otherwise found more information about distance walking than when they started.

The website is not the end point. It is a trailhead to other resources for distance walkers. The site should feature these elements, in order of priorty.

1. New media
2. New maps
3. Off-site resources

## Inspiration
Bitter Southerner for the polish and focus on letting people tell their stories (media). Nimblewill Nomad's website, for the trail accounts, gear lists, focus on distance, and the excellent maps. Rever app for catering to a specific audience for map building. Furkot.org for trip planning that includes walking directions.
